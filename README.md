Smaller Projects from the computer science 1 course.

All of the projects are intro level programs demonstrating different functions.



Program List:



Simple Arithmetic

This project is a simple Java program that will take three inputs from the user. The first 2 are numbers and the third is a arithmetic symbol +, -, *, /. The program will then calculate the arithmetic and display the result to the console.

Pay
