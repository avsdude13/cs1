# Computer Science 1

Smaller Projects from the computer science 1 course.
All of the projects are intro level programs demonstrating different functions.

Program List:

Simple Arithmetic-
This project is a simple Java program that will take three inputs from the user. The first 2 are numbers and the third is a arithmetic symbol +, -, *, /. The program will then calculate the arithmetic and display the result to the console.

Pay-
This is a simple Java program that asks user for two integer numbers hours and rate. Then will calculate the resulting pay for the hours worked and display the result.

Sales Tax-
This is a simple Java program that asks user for two inputs. A string listing the item and number price. It calculates the sales tax for the item and will return an itemized total showing item cost, tax and total.

Mileage-
This is a simple Java program that asks user for two inputs. The number of miles and number of gallons used. It calculates the mileage for the trip and will return the gas mileage achieved.

Numeric Types-
This is a simple Java program that will complete 4 simple tasks. The first task will calculate the average of 2 numbers. The second task will convert from F to C. The third task will make manipulations of a name. The fourth will calculate the volume of a sphere.

Pizza Order-
This is a simple Java program that will allow the user to select the toppings that they want on their pizza as well as size. It will then calculate the total and any discounts. The total pre tax, total tax and total will then be displayed.

Dice Simulator-
This class simulates rolling a pair of dice 10,000 times and counts the number of times doubles of are rolled for each different pair of doubles. 

Stats-
This program is for taking the contents of a file and calculating the mean and standard deviation, then returning the answer in a new file Results.txt

Geometry-
This program calculates the area of different shapes using static methods and case switch statements

Television and Television Demo-
This program demonstrates use of two files being used in conjuntion. The television demo controls the tv and the telivision class defines all the methods for the tv
